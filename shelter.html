        <h3>Meet Dave</h3>
          <p>Meet Dave, a 2-year-old Bulldog mix. Dave is a shy fellow with a gentle
         disposition who loves to go on walks. Time spent with him just sitting is
          time well spent. As he warms up, he prefers a soft and slow touch. He would
          do best in a calm environment with a mellow resident dog who can boost his
          confidence and show him the world doesn't have to be a scary place. Meet this
           beautiful boy at pet shelter today.</p>

        <h3>Meet George</h3>
          <p>Meet George, a handsome 12-year-young boy tabby, who can't wait to meet you! George came
           to the shelter, through no fault of his own, when his previous owner could no longer take care of
           him. It's been a bit stressful for George having to get used to his new temporary living situation,
            and he may seem a little shy at first. Once he knows you're his friend, though, George will warm
            up to you quickly. He loves it when you give him gentle scratches under his chin and chest, and
            he'll come alive when you toss him a rattling toy. He is quite the looker, but he gets a lot of
            compliments about his feet because he has extra toes. George has lived with dogs and adult children,
            but he would love to find a new home that is on the mellow side.</p>

      <h3>Meet Bella</h3>
        <p>Meet Bella, a 2-year-old grey and white short-haired girl who was surrendered to us through
           no fault of her own. Bella is friendly and sweet, but will need a patient adopter to help
           her confident side shine through. She has lived with other animals, but would probably do
           best in a quiet, adult only home. Come meet Bella today at the shelter!</p>
